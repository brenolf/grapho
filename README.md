# Grapho.js

## Motivation

Grapho.js is a light-weight javascript library to manipulate graph structures empowered with aliases and graph theory algorithms.

One can easily use it without profoundly knowing neither graph theory terminology nor its algorithms, working as a black-boxed data structure to relationships between any object in javascript.
