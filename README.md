# Grapho [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/grapho.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/grapho) [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/brenolf/grapho/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/brenolf/grapho/tree/master)

## Motivation

Grapho is a light-weight JavaScript library to manipulate graphs on client-side. It uses ES6 syntax to make it easier to extend the structure to whatever is suitable.

One can easily use it without profoundly knowing neither graph theory terminology nor its algorithms, working as a black-boxed data structure for relationships between any object in JavaScript. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended for the user to have at least a basic notion of Graph Theory.

## Installation

For local usage on any project, run `npm install grapho --save-dev`. There is also a gulp task that generates ES5 code for browsers: `gulp build`.
