# Grapho

## Motivation

Grapho.js is a light-weight javascript library to manipulate graphs on client-side. It uses ES6 syntax to make ir easier to extend the structure to whatever is suitable.

One can easily use it without profoundly knowing neither graph theory terminology nor its algorithms, working as a black-boxed data structure for relationships between any object in javascript.
